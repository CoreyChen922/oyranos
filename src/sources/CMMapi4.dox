/** @struct  oyCMMapi4_s

 *  @brief   Context creator
 *  
 *  The structure contains functions to specify and prepare parameters or
 *  a context dedicated for a filter node class. UI elements can be included for
 *  manual settings. As per definition the result of this filter is serialised,
 *  and can therefore be cached by Oyranos' core.
 *
 *  Different filters have to provide this struct each one per filter.
 *
 *  The oyCMMFilterNode_ContextToMem @see oyCMMFilterNode_ContextToMem_f
 *  should be implemented in case the context_type is set to a
 *  context data type.
 *
 *  @todo in commit 5a2b7396 the connection descriptors where moved to 
 *  oyCMMapi7_s. For a context, which must be created from the processing data
 *  this is not relyable, as the interpolator can not be shure that the context
 *  plug-in supports the same or larger set of connectors.
 *
 *  @version Oyranos: 0.9.5
 *  @since   2008/06/24 (Oyranos: 0.1.8)
 *  @date    2013/06/09
